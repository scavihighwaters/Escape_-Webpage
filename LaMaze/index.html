            <p>This project has been submitted on 11th of April, 2024 as an end-semester project in the course of web technology in our fourth semester. This project has been created under the guidance of Prof. Chandan Misra.</p>
            <p>We would like to extend our gratitude to everyone who made this project come true, our professor, for giving us this platform and also the opportunity to showcase our creativity with our limited knowledge, our friends, who helped us regularly both in and outside the project and who contributed in enculcating a collaborative environment. We hope to develop on these skills even more and improve this project into a full-fledged game and deploy it in the future.</p>
